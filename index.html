This visualization attempts to capture this devastating number through the use of time. 1 in 500 deaths translates to approximately <b>49 deaths each hour</b> since the first death from COVID-19 was recorded on February 29th, 2020.</p>
                    <p>The visualization runs for one hour. Each circle represents a person who died from COVID-19 in an average hour.</p>
                    <p>The duration of time it takes for a circle to travel from its starting place to its final resting place represents the frequency at which people from each age group died throughout the pandemic. Older people represent a disproportionate number of deaths compared with younger people.</p>
